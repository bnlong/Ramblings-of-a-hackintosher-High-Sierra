# Hackintosh hardware selection

Some of you may have seen the tonymacx86 buyers guide, which includes mostly intel boards & CPUs and Nvidia GPUs. Although it is possible to install macos on a PC that has an AMD CPU & motherboard, I don't recommend it. For my personal choice in hardware selection for a hackintosh, I would pick a combination of the following:
* A not too new motherboard that is confirmed to be supported with hackintoshing (search google for "motherboard name hackintosh", the board is probably compatible if there are several results)
* A nice and powerful CPU, think of an i7 or high-end i5. These tend to run the smoothest.
* 8-16GB of RAM, Corsair, G.SKILL or Kingston generally works. I haven't heard of any brand that works better or worse.
* An Nvidia GPU or an AMD GPU that people have tested and works.
* Case wise: a case with airflow.
