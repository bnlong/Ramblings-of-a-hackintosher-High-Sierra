## How to mount EFI
Open Terminal and run `diskutil list`, this will show you all your available Volumes. Look up your disk's name and remember the disk identifier that corresponds with your disk (this should look something like diskX). Once you're sure you have the right disk identifier that corresponds with your disk, run `diskutil mount diskXs1`, with the X being your disk number.

If you have only one EFI partition, you can also run `diskutil mount EFI`.
